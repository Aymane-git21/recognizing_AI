# MNIST Digit Classification Mini-Project

This mini-project serves as a **starter project** to help me push my boundaries in learning more about **deep learning**, **supervised learning tasks**, and **artificial neural networks**. The focus is on **classifying handwritten digits** from the MNIST dataset using a neural network.

## Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to take an input image of a handwritten digit (28x28 pixels, grayscale) and predict the corresponding digit (0-9).

- **Input**: A 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten number.
- **Output**: A digit (0-9) that represents the handwritten number.

For simplicity, the model will use the **sigmoid activation function** instead of ReLU. This choice may be changed later depending on performance and learning objectives.
