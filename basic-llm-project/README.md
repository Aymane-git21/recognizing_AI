# Basic LLM Project

This project implements a basic Language Model (LLM) designed for text generation tasks. It includes components for model definition, data handling, training, and utility functions.

## Project Structure

│   ├── training
│   │   └── train.py      # Contains the training process for the LLM
│   └── utils
│       └── helpers.py    # Utility functions for configuration and model saving
├── requirements.txt      # Lists project dependencies
├── .gitignore            # Specifies files to ignore in Git
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd basic-llm-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the model, run the training script:
```
python src/training/train.py
```

## Model Architecture

The LLM is designed to generate coherent text based on input prompts. It utilizes state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing to achieve high-quality text generation.
